      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">Electronic sports, or eSports for short, is quite similar to that of mainstream sport.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">Multiple parties are trying to win the game enabling the community</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">to commit to a game or sport by watching other players compete on a high level</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">in the game.&nbsp;Like in other sports, there are different types of genres.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">The most successful include strategy games, fighting games, and shooters.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">&nbsp;These are mainly popular because they appeal to a big audience and have the</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">highest prize money. All genres are available to watch on Twitch and YouTube</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">but can also sometimes get streamed live on television.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">Here we included a video of an Apex Legends tournament from last year.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">In the video, you can notice that the mechanics are quite like ordinary sports</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">with someone commenting on every single move the competitors make.</font></p><iframe height="315" src=

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">A few months ago, I started to become good at a game and got invited to play in an official tournament,</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">I practiced a lot and was very hyped. I created my own team consisting mainly of me and my friends</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">and together we practiced every day. Unfortunately, the tournament got cancelled due to the coronavirus.</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">The first competition was in 1972.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">At that time, it was just two players fighting over a subscription of a magazine.</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">Now it has grown into a billion-dollar industry. We expect it to keep on this trend,</font></p>

      <p><font size="5" face="Tw Cen MT Condensed Extra Bold">and we even think it might even become as popular as mainstream sports.</font></p>
